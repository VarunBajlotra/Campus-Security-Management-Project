# Campus-Security-Management-Project
## Objective
The prime objective of the project is the development of a fully functional Security Management System that can be adopted by Institutions so as to ensure a safe working environment for every concerned individual. It aims at the implementation of the following essential features - 
1. Campus Entry-Exit System - A proper mechanism to monitor the entry and exit to the campus, and to determine the people present inside the campus at any given moment.

2. Gender Specific Hostel Entry System - A system to monitor the students attempting to enter the hostels. Only girls should be allowed to enter the hostels allocated to girls, and only boys in those allocated to boys.

3. Restricted Entry to certain areas - A system to monitor the entry to certain areas that contain information that is considered crucial and confidential.

4. Complaint Management System - A portal on which any person within the campus is able to file complaints regarding any possible issues - grievances, conflicts or cases of harassment.

5. 24 x 7 CCTV Surveillance - A system that enables security personnel to quickly access the footage recorded using the surveillance cameras. It is essential to ensure that almost every nook and corner of the campus must be under strict surveillance. 
The project aims to make a reliable, highly secure software that is scalable, flexible, portable and maintainable.
